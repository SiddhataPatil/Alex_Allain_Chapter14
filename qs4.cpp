 Question    :Write a program that lets users keep track of the last time they talked to each of their friends.
              Users should be able to add new friends (as many as they want!) and store the number of days
              ago that they last talked to each friend. Let users update this value (but don't let them put in
              bogus numbers like negative values). Make it possible to display the list sorted by the names of
              the friends of by how recently it was since they talked to each friend.
